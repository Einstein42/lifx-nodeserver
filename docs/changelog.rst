Changelog
=====

0.1.3
~~~~~

Implemented a "Change HSBKD" for each node type (group and bulb) to allow you to change
all the values at once instead of making a step for each value. See the group documentation
for usage information.

0.1.2
~~~~~

Updated to include Group functionality. Currently only supports, On, Off and Change Color.
Membership is updated every 30 seconds, if you rename a group you will have to delete
it out of ISY and restart the LIFX node server to have it re-discover. ISY does not support
readdressing devices at this time.

0.1.1
~~~~~

Inital release.
